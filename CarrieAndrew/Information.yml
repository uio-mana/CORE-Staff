description:
  - Hei! I am currently a fixed-term Researcher (August 2023 - May 2025) at the Natural History Museum in Oslo, Norway. I am contributing to research and instructive workshops as part of the "Biodiversity Digital Twin project," focusing on data and information science of biodiversity data. Prior to this (July 2022 - June 2023), I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio (US), where I taught mycology (field- and quantitative-based) and general biology lectures & labs, and contributed to undergraduate student research. There are also quite a few other places that I have spent time at across the years, whether in research or teaching (please see below). I am glad to be back in Oslo and at the NHM!
