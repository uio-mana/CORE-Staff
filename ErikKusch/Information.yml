description:
  - My interests rest chiefly in the development of data and analysis workflows for quantitative ecological research. To this end, my current research spans the wide-ranging conceptualisations of systems resilience, ecological interactions, and biodiversity patterns as well as processes as driven by anthropogenic impacts. I deeply enjoy integrating cross-disciplinary state-of-the-art resources and analytical/quantitative methodology to unravel what governs natural as well as man-made ecosystems. I strongly believe that such cross-disciplinary method development efforts should ought to be communicated effectively and am consequently highly passionate about educating fellow researchers, students, and members of wider society on cutting-edge statistical approaches.
