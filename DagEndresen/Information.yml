description:
  - I am the Node Manager of the Norwegian participant node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The secretariat for GBIF Norway is hosted by the University of Oslo Natural History Museum. I provide support and teaching related to biodiversity data publication and analysis. My academic interests include biodiversity informatics, including biodiversity data standards, knowledge organization systems, geographic information management, and predictive modeling of biodiversity data in an ecological context (including modeling of crop traits useful for plant breeding programs in agriculture).
