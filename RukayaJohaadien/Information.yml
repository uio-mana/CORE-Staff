description:
  - I build and design data publication pipelines and provide technical support for Norwegian researchers and students wishing to publish data. A large portion of my time is also spent teaching at workshops and courses on biodiversity informatics and open data publication, both nationally and internationally. I am very interested in using AI to fast track data management and make data publication easier and more accessible for ad hoc data publication.
